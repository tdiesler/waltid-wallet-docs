# Issuer & Verifier Portals

The Issuer and Verifier Portals are **demo web portals** showcasing the scenarios of getting verifiable credentials issued into the wallet by a certified issuer or presenting a credential to a relying party. They can be used as reference implementations for issuers and verifiers to implement their own service platforms.

For credential and presentation exchange, we make use of the OIDC/SIOP protocols described in [OIDC](../../concepts/oidc/).
