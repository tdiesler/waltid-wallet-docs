# Architecture

Like the wallet-backend, the issuer and verifier portals are built on top of the SSI Kit, to leverage its functionality for issuing, signing and verifying credentials, provided by the Signatory and Auditor components resepectively.

Since the issuer and verifier backends are currently integrated with the wallet-backend project, refer to the [Architecture](../wallet/architecture.md) section for details.

To save you the roundtrip, in case you ended up on this page, here's the architecture diagram once more:
