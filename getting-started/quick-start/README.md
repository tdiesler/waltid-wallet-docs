# Quick start

Depending on your needs, there are several ways to get started with the walt.id SSI wallet and the issuer and verifier portals:

* **Docker compose**: Quick way to launch and try out the latest builds of the services. No build environment required, adaptation of default config may be necessary, depending on your setup.
* **Local docker build**: quickly build the individual services using Docker and launch the docker images. No local build environment required, besides docker.
* **Local gradle build**: Build and run the services locally on your machine. Requires build environment, including JDK 16, Gradle, NodeJs and Yarn.
* If you just want to try out the wallet and the issuer and verifier portals, you may directly use our **public deployments,** which don't require any configuration or build environment.&#x20;
