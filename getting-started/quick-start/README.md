# Quick start

Depending on your needs, there are several ways to get started with the walt.id SSI wallet and the issuer and verifier portals:

* [**Docker compose**](../quick-start/docker-compose.md): Quick way to launch and try out the latest builds of the services. No build environment required, adaptation of default config may be necessary, depending on your setup.
* [**Local docker build**](../quick-start/local-build.md#docker-build): quickly build the individual services using Docker and launch the docker images. No local build environment required, besides docker.
* [**Local build**](../quick-start/local-build.md#local-build): Build and run the services locally on your machine. Requires build environment, including JDK 16, Gradle, NodeJs and Yarn.
* If you just want to try out the wallet and the issuer and verifier portals, you may directly use our [**public deployments**](../public-deployments.md), which don't require any configuration or build environment.

Once you have the wallet backend up and running, you may want to explore the [**REST APIs**](../quick-start/rest-apis.md) exposed by the service.
