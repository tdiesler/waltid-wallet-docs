The stable deployment is updated manually whenever a stable release build is ready:

* Web wallet: [https://wallet.walt.id](https://wallet.walt.id)
* Issuer portal: [https://issuer.walt.id](https://issuer.walt.id)
* Verifier portal: [https://verifier.walt.id](https://verifier.walt.id)

## Rolling deployment

A deployment of the bleeding edge developments is updated in a rolling fashion on every successful build of the master branch of the wallet backend project.

This deployment should not be considered stable and should not be used for demo purposes, unless you want to try out a bleeding edge feature, that is not yet available in the stable deployment.

The rolling deployment is available for demo and trial at:

* Web wallet: [https://wallet.waltid.org](https://wallet.waltid.org)
* Issuer portal: [https://issuer.waltid.org](https://issuer.waltid.org)
* Verifier portal: [https://verifier.waltid.org](https://verifier.waltid.org)
