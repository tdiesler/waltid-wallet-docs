The Wallet is **a secure data hub for organizations and individuals** and enables them to act as "Holders": They can store, manage and share keys, identity data (e.g. Verifiable Credentials) and other secrets.

Practically speaking, the Wallet is a tool that allows anyone to **collect and present identity data** in order to access services (e.g. sign up, login, check-out) or procure products in a seamless and privacy preserving fashion.

Since there are different types of wallets, it is important to mention that our Wallet is a so-called **custodial wallet**, which means that keys and data are ultimately stored by the wallet provider. While this means less control for end-users, it also means a better user experience (e.g. no need to handle private keys or seed phrases) and less risk (e.g. loss of data). Also, end-users enjoy full data portability, which means that they can switch wallets (and take their keys and data with them) at any time without having to fear lock-in effects.
