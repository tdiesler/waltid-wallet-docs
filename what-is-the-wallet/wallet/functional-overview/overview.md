# Overview

Here are the most important things to know about the Wallet:

* It is **open source (Apache 2)**. You can use the code for free and without limitations.
* It is an **out-of-the-box solution** that you can simply re-use or even white-label such as for building pilot projects quickly.
* It is **customisable** in a sense that you can individualise the app based on your requirements: You can rebrand the app, build your own UI and add new features. \*\*\*\*
* It is **composable** in a sense that you can plug your existing (d)apps into the wallet backend in order to supercharge your (d)apps with SSI capabilities.
* It **abstracts complexity** such as low-level functionality related to key handling, data storage, signing and interactions with third party systems.
* It is **built on open standards** to ensure interoperability and prevent lock-in effects.
* It is **flexible** in a sense that you can deploy and run the Wallet on-premise, in your (multi) cloud environment or directly integrate our libraries.
* It enables you to **use different identity ecosystems** like Europeâ€™s emerging identity ecosystem ([EBSI, ESSIF](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/ebsi)) in anticipation of a multi-ecosystem future. (Consult the [SSI Kit documentation](https://app.gitbook.com/o/ZPIzdSlXqm9n9ywE2dcK/s/1k3zreXT6Nz41D1g1C6K/) to find out which ecosystems the Wallet supports.)&#x20;
