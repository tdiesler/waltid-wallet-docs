# Product & Dev Roadmap

Our product development process is public so that everyone can see what we are building. This way, we want to make it as easy as possible to

* [influence our roadmap](https://github.com/walt-id/.github/discussions/2)
* [contribute to our open source projects](broken-reference/)

You can find everything you need to know about our product and development plans in our _Roadmap_ and on our _Dev Board:_

## The "Roadmap"

The _Roadmap_ gives you a functional overview of our product plans and key releases. You can see:

* what we are working on (products, features),
* timelines (expected release dates),
* our motivation (why we are working on this issue).

The _Roadmap_ in a nutshell:

| **Purpose**         | Communicate goals and product plans publicly so that potentially anyone can influence and contribute. |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## The "Dev Board"

The _Dev Board_ gives you a detailed and technical perspective on our product plans by listing concrete issues and tasks on which developers are working.

The _Dev Board_ in a nutshell:
